# 🎓 365 Data Science: Student Engagement Analysis
In the digital era, e-learning platforms play a crucial role in providing flexible and high-quality education access. 365 Data Science is one of the leading platforms that enables students to learn data science and AI training holistically. To ensure an optimal learning experience and improve retention rates, it is essential to understand how students interact with the platform, from registration to content engagement and eventually subscription purchases.

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset includes student registration, engagement, and purchase history, providing a comprehensive view of their learning journey.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- SQL
- SQL Editor

## 🎯 Objectives
This case study explores key metrics such as the free-to-paid conversion rate, the average time from registration to first engagement, and the time from first engagement to purchase. Additionally, retention rate and churn rate will be analyzed to understand the sustainability of student subscriptions. By identifying these activity patterns, 365 Data Science can optimize engagement strategies, enhance user retention, and drive long-term growth.

## 📊 Analysis Results
### 1. Conversion Rate: 11.29%
Only 11.29% of students who start watching videos end up making a purchase. This indicates that the majority of students (almost 89%) who use the platform for free are either not interested or not sufficiently encouraged to make a purchase. Possible reasons could be a lack of incentives to subscribe, unclear premium benefits, or an overall user experience that is not engaging enough.

### 2. Average Time from Registration to First Watch: 3.42 days
On average, a student takes 3.42 days from the registration date to start watching their first video. This suggests that most students do not engage immediately after signing up, which could indicate a lack of initial appeal, an ineffective onboarding strategy, or a confusing user interface.

### 3. Average Time from Registration to Purchase: 29.75 days
Students who eventually make a purchase take an average of 29.75 days from registration to subscription. This shows that students need a significant amount of time to experience the platform's value before committing to a purchase.

### 4. Average Time from First Watch to Purchase: 26.25 days
After watching their first video, students still take 26.25 days before making a purchase. This suggests that the first viewing experience is not strong enough to immediately drive conversions.

### 5. Retention Rate: 4.65%
Only 4.65% of students make more than one purchase. This indicates that most students who purchase a subscription only do so once and do not renew. Possible reasons could be a lack of ongoing exclusive content, pricing misalignment with expectations, or insufficient personalization in the learning journey.

### 6. Churn Rate: 88.71%
A very high churn rate (88.71%) indicates that most students who start watching videos do not proceed to purchase. This suggests that while they are initially interested in trying the platform, they are not sufficiently encouraged to commit further.

### 7. Same-Day Conversion Rate: 5.57%
Only 5.57% of students make a purchase on the same day they start watching. This suggests that most students need more time to explore the platform before making a purchasing decision.

## 🏆 Conclusion
The platform faces key problems including:
- A low conversion rate and high churn rate indicate difficulties in converting free users into paying customers.
- The long average time from registration to purchase suggests potential improvements in onboarding and promotional strategies.
- A low retention rate implies that the platform needs to enhance the appeal of its content and long-term value for paying subscribers.
